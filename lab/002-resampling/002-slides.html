## Review

.b[Cross validation].super[.pink[†]] (CV) aims to .pink[estimate out-of-sample performance]

.footnote[
.pink[†] Plus other resampling (and specifically hold-out) methods
]

1. .hi-pink[efficiently], using the full dataset to both .it[train] and .it[test] (validate)

1. .hi-pink[without overfitting], separating observations used to .it[train] or .it[test]

--

.b[CV] (_e.g._, LOOCV and `\(k\)`-fold) aids with .purple[several tasks]

- .hi-purple[model selection]: choosing key parameters for a model's flexibility
&lt;br&gt;_e.g._, .it[K] in KNN, polynomials and interactions for regression (.it[AKA] tuning)

- .hi-purple[model assessment]: determining how well the model performs
&lt;br&gt;_e.g._, estimating the true test MSE, MAE, or error rate

---

# Cross validation
## `\(k\)`-fold cross validation, review

1. .b[Divide] training data into `\(k\)` folds (mutally exclusive groups)
1. .it[For each fold] `\(i\)`:
  - .b[Train] your model on all observations, excluding members of `\(i\)`
  - .b[Test] and .b[assess] model.sub[i] on the members of fold `\(i\)`, _e.g._, MSE.sub[i]
1. .b[Estimate test performance] by averaging across folds, _e.g._, Avg(MSE.sub[i])

For `\(k=5\)`, fold number `\(1\)` as the .hi-slate[validation set] produces MSE.sub[k=1].

For `\(k=5\)`, fold number `\(2\)` as the .hi-slate[validation set] produces MSE.sub[k=2].

## Independence

.b[Resampling methods] assume something similar to independence: our resampling must match the original sampling procedure.

--

If observations are "linked" but we resample independently, CV may break.

--

If we have .hi-pink[repeated observations] on individuals `\(i\)` through time `\(t\)`:
- It's pretty likely `\(y_{i,t}\)` and `\(y_{i,t+1}\)` are related—and maybe `\(y_{i,t+\ell}\)`.
- Initial sample may draw individuals `\(i\)`, but .it[standard] CV ignores time.

--

In other case, .hi-pink[some individuals are linked with other individuals], *e.g.*,
- `\(y_{i,t}\)` and `\(y_{j,t}\)` my be correlated if `\(i\)` and `\(j\)` live togother
- Also: `\(y_{i,t}\)` and `\(y_{j,t+\ell}\)` could be correlated

---
## Independence

In other words: Spatial or temporal .b[dependence] between observations .b[breaks the separation between training and testing samples].

--

Breaking this separation train-test separation leads us back to

- .b[Overfitting] the sample—since training and testing samples are linked

- .b[Overestimating model performance]—the estimated test MSE will be more of a training MSE.

--

.b[Solutions] to this problem involve .hi-pink[matching the resampling process] to the .hi-pink[original sampling and underlying dependence].

.ex[Examples:] Spatial `\(k\)`-fold CV (SKCV) and blocked time-series CV

## Dependence

.qa[Q] So how big of a deal is this type of depedence?

## Monte Carlo

.b[Monte Carlo simulation].super[.pink[†]] allows us model probabilistic questions.

.footnote[
.pink[†] Also called Monte Carlo methods, experiments, *etc.*
]

1. .b[Generate a population] defined by some data-generating process (DGP), a model of how your fake/simulated world works.
--
1. Repeatedly .b[draw samples] `\(s\)` from your population. .it[For each] `\(s\)`:
  - Apply the relevant methods, sampling techniques, estimators, *etc.*
  - Record your outcome(s) of interest (_e.g._, MSE or error rate), `\(O_s\)`
--
1. Use the .b[distribution] of the `\(O_s\)` to .it[learn] about your methods, sampling techniques, and/or estimators—the mean, bias, variability *etc.*

--

.note[Ex.sub[1]] We can change DGP in (1) to see how performance (3) changes.
&lt;br&gt;.note[Ex.sub[2]] Holding DGP (1) constant, we can compare competing methods (2).

name: sim-intro
## Introductory example: Define the question

It's always helpful to clearly define the question you want to answer, _e.g._:

.b[Example question:] Is OLS unbiased when `\(\varepsilon_i\sim\)` Uniform(0, 1)?

--

Now we know our goal: Determine unbiasedness (mean of distribution).

---
## Introductory example: DGP and population

We'll use the DGP `\(y_i = 3 + 6 x_i + \varepsilon_i\)`,
&lt;br&gt;where `\(\varepsilon_i\sim\)` Uniform(0, 1), and `\(x_i\sim\)` N(0, 1).


--


```r
# Set seed
set.seed(123)
# Define population size
pop_size = 1e4
# Generate population
ols_pop = tibble(
  # Generate disturbances: Using Uniform(0,1)
  e = runif(pop_size, min = 0, max = 1),
  # Generate x: Using N(0,1)
  x = rnorm(pop_size),
  # Calculate y
  y = 3 + 6 * x + e
)
```

---
## Introductory example: A single iteration

Now we want to write a function that
1. .b[samples] from the population `ols_pop`
2. .b[estimates OLS] regression on the sample
3. .b[records] the OLS estimate

--


```r
ols_function = function(iter, sample_size) {
  # Draw a sample of size 'sample_size'
  ols_sample = sample_n(ols_pop, size = sample_size)
  # Estimate OLS
  ols_est = lm(y ~ x, data = ols_sample)
  # Return coefficients and iteration number
  data.frame(b0 = coef(ols_est)[1], b1 = coef(ols_est)[2], iter)
}
```

---
## Introductory example: Run the simulation

For the simulation, we run our single-iteration function `ols_function()`
&lt;br&gt;.b[a bunch] of times (like 10,000) and then collect the results..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[
.pink[†] The `apply()` family and parallelization are both key here (`future.apply` combines them).
]






```r
# Set up parallelization (with 12 cores)
# Warning: Can take a little time to run (esp w/out 12 cores)
plan(multiprocess, workers = 12)
# Set seed
set.seed(12345)
# Run simulation
ols_sim = future_lapply(
  X = 1:1e4,
  FUN = ols_function,
  sample_size = 50,
  future.seed = T
) %&gt;% bind_rows()
```

---
## Introductory example: Results

Now we're ready to summarize the results.

We wanted to know .b[if OLS is still unbiased].

Thus, plotting the .b[distributions of estimates] for `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)` will be of interest—.b[especially the means] of these distributions.

.note[Recall:] If an estimator is unbiased, then the mean of its distribution should like up with the parameter it is attempting to estimate.

# Monte Carlo
## Introductory example: Conclusion

When our disturbances are distributed as Uniform(0,1)

1. OLS is biased for `\(\beta_0\)` (the intercept)
1. OLS is still unbiased for `\(\beta_1\)` (the slope)

... and we were able to learn all of this information by simulation.

layout: true
# Simulation: `\(k\)`-fold CV and dependence
## Our question

Let's write our previous question in a way we can try to answer it.

.b[Question:] How does .hi-purple[correlation between observations] affect the .hi-orange[performance] of `\(\color{#e64173}{k}\)`.hi-pink[-fold cross validation]?

---

We need to define some terms.

---

.hi-purple.it[correlation between observations]

- Observations can correlate in many ways. Let's keep it simple: we will simulate repeated observations (through time, `\(t\)`) on individuals, `\(i\)`.
- .hi-purple[DGP:] Continuous `\(y_{i,t}\)` has a predictor `\(x_{i,t}\)` and two random disturbances
$$
`\begin{align}
  y_{i,t} &amp;= 3 x_{i,t} - 2 x_{i,t}^2 + 0.1 x_{i,t}^4 + \gamma_i + \varepsilon_{i,t} \\
  x_{i,t} &amp;= 0.9 x_{i,t-1} + \eta_{i,t} \\
  \varepsilon_{i,t} &amp;= 0.9 \varepsilon_{i,t-1} + \nu_{i,t} &amp;
\end{align}`
$$

---

.hi-orange.it[performance]
- We will focus on .hi-orange[MSE] for observations the model never saw.
- .it[Note:] .it[En route], we will meet .it[root] mean squared error (RMSE).
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{RMSE}=\sqrt{\text{MSE}}
\end{align}`
$$

---

`\(\color{#e64173}{k}\)`.hi-pink[-fold cross validation]
- We'll stick with 5-fold cross validation.
- Our answer shouldn't change too much based upon `\(k\)`.
- Feel free to experiment later...

### Set up population
- Set seed
- Define number of individuals `N` and time periods `T`


```r
# Set seed
set.seed(12345)
# Size of the population
N = 1000
# Number of time periods per individual
T = 50
# Create the indices of our population
pop_df = expand_grid(
  i = 1:N,
  t = 1:T
)
```

---
### Build population
- Generate temporally correlated disturbances and predictor `\((x_{i,t})\)`
- Calculate outcome variable `\(y_{i,t}\)`


```r
# Disturbance for (i,t): Correlated within time (not across individuals)
pop_df %&lt;&gt;%
  group_by(i) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    x = arima.sim(model = list(ar = c(0.9)), n = T) %&gt;% as.numeric(),
    e_it = arima.sim(model = list(ar = c(0.9)), n = T) %&gt;% as.numeric()
  ) %&gt;% ungroup()
# Disturbance for (i): Constant within individual
pop_df %&lt;&gt;%
  group_by(i) %&gt;%
  mutate(e_i = runif(n = 1, min = -100, max = 100)) %&gt;%
  ungroup()
# Calculate 'y'; drop disturbances
pop_df %&lt;&gt;% mutate(
  y = e_i + 3 * x - 2 * x^2 + 0.1 * x^4 + e_it
) %&gt;% select(i, t, y, x)
```

.b[Next steps:] Write out a single iteration (to become a function).

1. Draw a sample.

1. Estimate a model: We're going to use KNN regression.

1. Tune our model: We will use 5-fold CV to choose 'K'.

1. Assess the model's performance (CV and in the population).
---
name: sim-kcv-sample
### Draw a sample


```r
# Define sample size (will be in input of our function)
n_i = 50
# Draw sample
i_sampled = sample.int(N, size = n_i)
# Draw a sample
sample_df = pop_df %&gt;% filter(i %in% i_sampled)
```

`sample.int(n, size)` draws `size` integers between 1 and `n`.

Note that we are .b[sampling individuals] (`i`).

---
name: sim-kcv-model
### Tune and estimate a model






```r
# Define number of folds
k_folds = 5
# k-fold CV
cv_output = train(
  # The relationship: y as a function of w and x
  y ~ .,
  # The method of estimating the model (linear regression)
  method = "knn",
  # The training data (which will be used for cross validation)
  data = sample_df %&gt;% select(y, x),
  # Controls for the model training: k-fold cross validation
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = k_folds),
  # Allow cross validation to choose best value of K (# nearest neighbors)
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(k = seq(1, 500, by = 5))
)
```

`train()` (from the `caret` package) assists in many training/tuning tasks (note `tuneGrid` argument)—including pre-processing data.
---
You can actually plot the results from `train()`, _i.e._,


```r
ggplot(cv_output) + theme_minimal()
```

&lt;img src="002-slides_files/figure-html/plot-cv-real-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

The output from `train()` also contains a lot of additional information, _e.g._,


```r
cv_output$results
```

Now we .b[assess the performance] of our chosen/tuned model.

1. Record the .hi-purple[CV-based MSE] (already calculated by `train()`).

2. Since we know the population, we can calculate the .hi-orange[true test MSE].

.hi-orange[(2)] is usually not available to use—you can see how simulation helps.
---
### Assess performance
- Subset to unseen data (individuals not sampled)
- Evaluate prediction performance on new individuals


```r
# Subset to unseen data
test_df = pop_df %&gt;% filter(i %&gt;% is_in(i_sampled) %&gt;% not())
# Make predictions on
predictions = predict(
  cv_output,
  newdata = test_df
)
# Calculate RMSE in full population
rmse_true = mean((test_df$y - predictions)^2) %&gt;% sqrt()
rmse_true
```

```
#&gt; [1] 60.98547

Now we basically wrap the last 7 slides into a function and we're set!
---
name: sim-kcv-function
### Function: One iteration of the simulation


```r
# Our function for a single iteration of the simulation
sim_fun = function(iter, n_i = 50, k_folds = 5) {
  # Draw sample
  i_sampled = sample.int(N, size = n_i)
  # Draw a sample
  sample_df = pop_df %&gt;% filter(i %in% i_sampled)
  # k-fold CV
  cv_output = cv_function(k_folds = k_folds)
  # Find the estimated MSE
  mse_est = mean(cv_output$resample$RMSE^2)
  # Subset to unseen data
  test_df = pop_df %&gt;% filter(i %&gt;% is_in(i_sampled) %&gt;% not())
  # Make predictions on true test data
  predictions = predict(cv_output, newdata = test_df)
  # Calculate RMSE in full population
  mse_true = mean((test_df$y - predictions)^2)
  # Output results
  data.frame(iter, k = cv_output$bestTune$k, mse_est, mse_true)
}
```
Notice that we can define default values for our function's arguments.

---
### Function: `\(k\)`-fold CV of KNN model for a sample


```r
# Wrapper function for caret::train()
cv_function = function(k_folds) {
  # The relationship: y as a function of w and x
  y ~ .,
  # The method of estimating the model (linear regression)
  method = "knn",
  # The training data (which will be used for cross validation)
  data = sample_df %&gt;% select(y, x),
  # Controls for the model training: k-fold cross validation
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = k_folds),
  # Allow cross validation to choose best value of K (# nearest neighbors)

Now run our one-iteration function `sim_fun()` for many iterations!

---
### Run the simulation!


```r
# Set seed
set.seed(123)
# Run simulation 1,000 times in parallel (and time)
tic()
sim_df = mclapply(
  X = 1:1e3,
  FUN = sim_fun,
  mc.cores = 11
) %&gt;% bind_rows()
toc()
# Save dataset
write_csv(
  x = sim_df,
  path = here("cv-sim-knn.csv")
)
```

`tic()` and `toc()` come from `tictoc()` and help with timing tasks.
&lt;br&gt;`mclapply()` is a parallelized `lapply()` from `parallel` (sorry, no Windows).
